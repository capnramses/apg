/* apg_pixfont - C Pixel Font Utility v0.1.0
LICENCE: see bottom of this file
==============================================================
Authors and Contributors:

What Does It Do?
==============================================================
- Given a string of text, renders it into an image, in pre-allocated memory, using an embedded pixel font.
- Useful for quick & dirty text output in graphics software. eg FPS counters or debug-on-screen text, or pixel-art games.
- Tells you how much memory to allocate for an image to fit a given string.
- Can set the number of colour channels, and those colours, for the text.
- Can add pixel art outlines to the text.

What Doesn't It Do?
==============================================================
- Contain a file output API. If you want to save to a file use stb_image_write or libpng etc.
- Characters rendered are limited to those in the font - 1-byte-per-codepoint ASCII, and a limited selection of other Latin alphabet glyphs (basic accents,
umlauts).

Instructions:
==============================================================
1. Copy apg_pixfont.c and apg_pixfont.h into your project's source code files.
   You don't need to copy the image file for the font - it's embedded in the C file.

2. Find out the required image dimensions

int w, h;
int n_channels = 1;
int thickness = 1;
bool outlines = false;

apg_pixfont_image_size_for_str( "my_string", &w, &h, thickness, outlines );

3. Allocate the memory

unsigned char* img_mem = (unsigned char*)malloc( w * h * n_channels );
memset( img_mem, 0x00, w * h * n_channels );

4. Then paint the string onto the memory

apg_pixfont_str_into_image( "my_string", img_mem, w, h, n_channels, 0xFF, 0x7F, 0x00, 0xFF, thickness, outlines );

==============================================================

Technical Details:
==============================================================
- Implementation is C99, interface is C89.

TODO:
==============================================================
- Support more glyphs - e.g. French { ç â à }

History:
==============================================================
0.1.0 - 2022 Apr 23 - Carriage return \r is ignored.
0.0.5 - 2021 Jan 31 - apg_pixfont_image_size_for_str() always returns even dimensions, padding a pixel if required. Helps image alignment.
0.0.4 - 2021 Jan 05 - Removed vflip again, to simplify code in several places.
0.0.3 - 2019 Aug 11 - Added vflip option back in, and reconciled with outline drawing block.
0.0.2 - 2019 Aug 11 - Thickness (scaling) API, revised outlines code to suite, removed vertical flip option from interface.
0.0.1 - 2019 Aug 9 - Split into stand-alone library code.
0.0.0 - 2018 - First version by Anton, as part of voxel game project

/* Get image dimensions required for writing full string into with str_into_image()

ARGUMENTS:
* ascii_str - null-terminated string to render. ASCII plus a few basic UTF-8 encoded Unicode Latin characters are supported.
* w,h - minimum dimensions of image require to fix the whole string.
* thickness - A scaling factor for the text ( default is 1px thick glyph stems ).
* add_outline - if the text will add an outline to the right and bottom of glyph pixels 0=no, 1=yes

RETURNS:
* APG_PIXFONT_FAILURE on error (zero-length strings, NULL pointer args), otherwise success

CAVEATS: image widths will always tightly fit text size
* Very short strings, eg '|' will produce images that are smaller than 4-byte-aligned memory expected by eg OpenGL textures.
  To address this you could pad the image, or set OpenGL byte alignment to 1
* If you want power-of-two sized images then allocate the next power-of-two size up.

/* Writes an ASCII string into a 1-channel image using the pixel font.
Allocate image memory first and clear as desired. font writes over the top in 1-channel white.
'Thickness' is useful for making big headings. Note that the outline will not scale, it stays 1px thick, which gives a consistent look.

ARGUMENTS:
* ascii_str - null-terminated string to render. ASCII plus a few basic UTF-8 encoded Unicode Latin characters are supported.
* image - a pre-allocated block of memory to draw the image into. Use image_size_for_str() to find the size required for this.
* w, h - dimensions of image to write into. If text pixels extend out of these bounds it won't attempt to write anything there.
* vertically_flip - Image can be vertically flipped (0=no,1=yes) for eg OpenGL textures.
* n_channels - 1 for greyscale, 2 for RG, 3 for RGB, 4 for RGBA. if using 2-4 then size memory allocated for image should reflect that.
* r,g,b,a - colour of the text. 1-channel uses only red colour. 2-channel uses only red and alpha. 3-channel uses r,g,b. 4-channel uses all.
* thickness - A scaling factor for the text ( default is 1px thick glyph stems ).
* add_outline - if the text will add an outline to the right and bottom of glyph pixels 0=no, 1=yes

RETURNS:
* returns APG_PIXFONT_FAILURE on error, otherwise success
