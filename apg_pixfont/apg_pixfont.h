/* apg_pixfont - C Pixel Font Utility
LICENCE: see bottom of this file
By Anton Gerdelan - @capnramses - <antongdl@protonmail.com>

What Does It Do?
==============================================================
- Given a string of text, renders it into an image, in pre-allocated memory, using an embedded pixel font.
- Useful for quick & dirty text output in graphics software. eg FPS counters or debug-on-screen text, or pixel-art games.
- Tells you how much memory to allocate for an image to fit a given string.
- Can set the number of colour channels, and those colours, for the text.
- Can add pixel art outlines to the text.

What Doesn't It Do?
==============================================================
- Contain a file output API. If you want to save to a file use stb_image_write or libpng etc.
- Characters rendered are limited to those in the font - 1-byte-per-codepoint ASCII, and a limited selection of other Latin alphabet glyphs (basic accents,
umlauts).

Instructions:
==============================================================
1. Copy apg_pixfont.c and apg_pixfont.h into your project's source code files.
   You don't need to copy the image file for the font - it's embedded in the C file.

2. Find out the required image dimensions

    int w, h;              // Image dimensions.
    int n_channels = 1;    // Greyscale image output.
    int thickness = 1;     // Single-pixel thick glyph lines.
    int col_max = 0;       // Maximum characters in a line. Zero means no limit.
    bool outlines = false; // If true, also draw a partial outline.

    apg_pixfont_image_size_for_str( "my_string", &w, &h, thickness, outlines, col_max );

3. Allocate the memory

    unsigned char* img_mem = (unsigned char*)malloc( w * h * n_channels );
    memset( img_mem, 0x00, w * h * n_channels );

4. Then paint the string onto the memory

    apg_pixfont_str_into_image( "my_string", img_mem, w, h, n_channels, 0xFF, 0x7F, 0x00, 0xFF, thickness, outlines, col_max );

Advanced Tips:
==============================================================
*. If you want characters to wrap around at some line limit, you can set `col_max` to some number. This will just do the following:

From:

     col max
       |
A verylongword.
       |

To:
       |
A verylo
ngword.
       |

*. If you want words to wrap neatly at the end of a line, you can call the replace whitespace preceding
  overlapping words with linebreaks. Do this before calling the functions in steps 2 and 3.

    apg_pixfont_word_wrap_str( my_string, 60 );

This will achieve the following:

From:

         col max
            |
A verylongword.
            |

To:
            |
A
verylongword.
            |

==============================================================

Technical Details:
==============================================================
- Implementation is C99, interface is C89.

TODO:
==============================================================
- Support more glyphs - e.g. French { ç â à }, and put them in Unicode order.
- Fix up ampersand, quotation marks, etc glyphs, as from gfx_expmts repo.

History:
==============================================================
0.4.4 - 2024 Oct 18 - Outline is now a darker shade of text colour, not black.
0.4.0 - 2024 Jun 15 - Most of Latin-1 character set included.
0.3.0 - 2023 Mar 09 - Bold/italic/underline/strikethrough style. '\n's at the end of strings trimmed. Atlas generation tools. Basic Unicode UTF-8 support.
0.2.1 - 2022 Sep 26 - Readme correction.
0.2.0 - 2022 Sep 25 - Word-wrap function.
0.1.1 - 2022 Sep 22 - Tidied comments. Character-based wrap option.
0.1.0 - 2022 Apr 23 - Carriage return \r is ignored.
0.0.5 - 2021 Jan 31 - apg_pixfont_image_size_for_str() always returns even dimensions, padding a pixel if required. Helps image alignment.
0.0.4 - 2021 Jan 05 - Removed vflip again, to simplify code in several places.
0.0.3 - 2019 Aug 11 - Added vflip option back in, and reconciled with outline drawing block.
0.0.2 - 2019 Aug 11 - Thickness (scaling) API, revised outlines code to suite, removed vertical flip option from interface.
0.0.1 - 2019 Aug 9  - Split into stand-alone library code.
0.0.0 - 2018        - First version by Anton, as part of voxel game project

 * @note
 * Image widths returned will always tightly fit text size. You can, however, use a large image than this.
 * If the provided image is smaller than the reported size required then text will appear cut off on the image boundary.
 * Very short strings, eg '|' will produce images that are smaller than 4-byte-aligned memory expected by eg OpenGL textures.
 * To address this you could pad the image, or set OpenGL byte alignment to 1.
 * If you want power-of-two sized images then allocate the next power-of-two size up.

/** Writes an ASCII string into an image using the pixel font.
 * Allocate image memory first and clear to a background colour as desired. The pixel font text writes over the top in white.

 * @param ascii_str
 * Null-terminated string to render. ASCII plus a few basic UTF-8 encoded Unicode Latin characters are supported.
 * @param image
 * A pre-allocated block of memory to draw the image into. Use image_size_for_str() to find the size required for this.

 * Dimensions of image to write into. If text pixels extend out of these bounds it won't attempt to write anything there.
 * @param vertically_flip
 * Image can be vertically flipped (0=no,1=yes) for e.g. OpenGL textures.
 * @param n_channels
 * 1 for greyscale, 2 for RG, 3 for RGB, 4 for RGBA. if using 2-4 then size memory allocated for image should reflect that.
 * @param r,g,b,a
 * Colour of the text. 1-channel uses only red colour. 2-channel uses only red and alpha. 3-channel uses r,g,b. 4-channel uses all.

 * A scaling factor for the text ( default is 1px thick glyph stems ). Useful for making big headings.
 * @param add_outline
 * If the text will add an outline to the right and bottom of glyph pixels 0=no, 1=yes.
 * Note that the outline will not scale, it stays 1px thick, which gives a consistent look.
