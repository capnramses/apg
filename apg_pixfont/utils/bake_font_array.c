/**
 * @file bake_font_array.c
 *
 * @author Anton Gerdelan - @capnramses - <antongdl@protonmail.com>.
 *
 * @brief Stand-alone utility program for updating apg_pixfont.c with a new hard-coded font image.
 *
 * Example use case:
 *   "Ah! I forgot to add Ãª to the typeface image...let's paint that into the reference image and then
 *   update the hard-coded version in the library."
 *
 * Input
 *   some_font_image.png
 *
 * Output
 *   A C array in text is written to stdout that can be copy-pasted over the font array in apg_pixfont.c code.
 *
 * Build
 *   cc -o bake_font bake_font_array.c -lm -I ../../third_party/
 *
 * Usage
 *   ./bake_font MY_IMAGE.png > some_code.c
 *
 * Licence: See bottom of this file.
