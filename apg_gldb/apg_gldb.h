/*
OpenGL Debug Drawing Functions
https://github.com/capnramses/opengl_debug_draw
C89 interface, C99 implementation.
Requires OpenGL 3.0 Core or newer, or an older version supporting  ARB_vertex_array_object.
Requires GLSL 1.2.0 or newer.

LICENCE - See bottom of this file.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
 1. Drop the .c and .h file into your project's source code.
 2. Modify apg_gldb.c to include your OpenGL header. e.g.

    // #include "apg_glcontext.h" // REPLACE THIS INCLUDE WITH YOUR PROJECT'S OPENGL HEADER
    #include <glad/glad.h> // Your header here.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
 1. #include "apg_db.h"
 2. Call apg_gldb_init() before adding geometry, but after starting your window and OpenGL context.
 3. Add line-based geometry with the apg_gldb_add_...() functions.
 4. When drawing, update the camera matrix with apg_gldb_update_cam() and then call apg_gldb_draw().
 5. To modify lines call the corresponding apg_gldb_mod_...() functions.
 6. Call apg_gldb_free() when done i.e. at the end of your program.

HISTORY

  0.4   - 18 May 2020 - const.
  0.3   - 13 May 2020 - Tidied API and docs. Added _mod_ function for AABB and frustum.
  0.2   - 16 Jun 2015 - Feature complete v. original spec.
  0.1   - 11 Jun 2015 - First version.

TODO
 - Recreate test/example program.
 - Add test build to CI/CD tests.
